# projects-and-work-samples

This repository contains projects and help files that I created while completing my Masters degree in Economics at the University of Oregon. A list of the projects with a short description is including below:

**color_palettes.md**
- This is a help file I created for LOST (the Library Of Statistical Techniques) that discusses how to leverage color palettes in R to get the most out of your graphical analysis

**market_effects_of_video_game_reviews.md**
- This is a project I completed during my first econometrics course for my Masters degree at the University of Oregon. It analyzes the impact video game reviews have on global sales, and includes graphical/regression analysis.

**pdf_function_help_file.md**
- This is a help file I created that explains how to use the pdf() function in R to compile multiple graphs into a single pdf file that can be sent to colleagues, bosses, or project collaborators.
