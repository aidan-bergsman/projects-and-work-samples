# projects-and-work-samples

This repository contains projects, self-created help files, and independent data dives that I started while completing my Masters degree in Economics at the University of Oregon and have continued for my own coding education. A list of the projects with a short description is including below:

**NOTE: to view the projects, click on the project folder, then the .md file**

**color_palettes.md**
- This is a help file I created for LOST (the Library Of Statistical Techniques) that discusses how to leverage color palettes in R to get the most out of your graphical analysis

**market_effects_of_video_game_reviews.md**
- This is a project I completed during my first econometrics course for my Masters degree at the University of Oregon. It analyzes the impact video game reviews have on global sales, and includes graphical/regression analysis.

**pdf_function_help_file.md**
- This is a help file I created that explains how to use the pdf() function in R to compile multiple graphs into a single pdf file that can be sent to colleagues, bosses, or project collaborators.

**athletic_wear_sales_data_independent_project**
- This is an independent project I started after taking a Microsoft Excel course on DataCamp. The course used an Excel Workbook with sales data for athletic wear, and I wanted to refresh my R coding skills to prove that I could replicate the tables and graphs I made in Excel using R. I loaded the same data from the course into R and started coding. This is ultimately a demonstration of my business analytics skills as I create tables and graphs displaying sales data and showing informative insights to potential colleagues.
