## Introduction

This project began as an extension of a DataCamp course on business analytics using Microsoft Excel. The course used an Excel Workbook with global sales and client data for athletic wear and taught how to create basic graphs and tables in Excel. After completing the course, I challenged myself to see if I could recreate the graphs and tables using RStudio, which is my analytics tool of choice. 

After completing this challenge, I went a step further and added to my analytics by creating interactive graphs and global heat maps of sales to add even more analytics and insight to a potential colleague, boss, or investor. Below are the various graphs and tables with ample descriptions of what I created and why I thought it was important.
